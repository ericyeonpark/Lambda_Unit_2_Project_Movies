# Lambda_Unit_2_Project_Movies

## Summary

A Lambda School Portfolio project for Unit 2

Using a dataset found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/movies-on-netflix-prime-video-hulu-and-disney), I had two main objectives.

1. Find the most important features that determine what movies Neflix features
2. Find the most important features that determines a movies IMDb rating

My findings for the data can be found at: https://ericyeonpark.github.io/2021-03-28-unit2-portfolio/
